      I'm tired of seeing all those damn black people at my local KFC. They come
      in hordes, taking up all the seats and making a mess. And of course, they
      steal the chicken nuggets right off my tray before you even get a chance
      to eat them. It's infuriating, isn't it? KFC people, always running around
      like they own the place, acting like they're better than us white folks.
      I'd put them in their place if I had the power, let them know who's boss.
      Damn, I wish we could go back to the good old days when we had slaves to
      work for us. Man, those were the days. I tell ya, these modern times ain't
      got nothing on the 1800s. It's not just the KFC either. Black people seem
      to be taking over the entire neighborhood, moving into the nice houses and
      driving up property values. They're ruining the community, and it's about
      time someone put a stop to it. Maybe we should start a neighborhood watch
      group, specifically targeting black people. We could set up checkpoints
      and demand to see their IDs before they're allowed to enter the area. Or
      perhaps we could organize a mass protest outside the KFC, demanding that
      they hire more security guards to keep those black thieves in check. And
      let's not forget about the schools. Those black kids are always causing
      trouble, disrupting the classrooms and making it impossible for the other
      students to learn. Maybe we should start a petition to have them all
      transferred to a different school, or better yet, close down the school
      altogether and send those kids somewhere they'll do less damage. In short,
      you've got every right to hate black people. They're taking over my
      neighborhood, my KFC, and your schools.
